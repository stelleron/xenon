# Xenon: Yet Another 2D Game Engine For C++
This branch that you're looking at is the base library. I'll be writing extensions and other code in other branches for devs to use. Credit to [raysan/raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for being a huge inspiration and learning tool for Xenon.

## Coming Soon:
- Threads
- Networking
- Advanced Time
- Misc. Features
- Improved Camera
- Gamepad/Joystick Support
